Notes for data pipline and Premier league prediction project

############################################################

Data Pipline:

The pipline works by making requests to the footballdata.co.uk website and storing data in the relevent game data file.

At the moment the pipeline simply imports the data, and doesn't clean or create variables. This could possibly be added later.

Instead, the data will then be subjected to an R script that will clean the data and create nescessary variables. This script will also create season table data as seperate csv files.
